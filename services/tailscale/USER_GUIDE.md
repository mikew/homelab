This gives you access to devices on your home network, even when your outside of your home.

To do this, you need to log in to tailscale, and on the Machines tab, make sure you've enabled subnet routing for your homelab machine.

You can also disable Key Expiry for the machine, which will save you from having to re-authenticate every 90 days.

It can be used as an alternative to making your services open to the internet at large. Read the DNS guide for more info on that.
